# EvoNAS4DLD
Feature Separation in Diffuse Lung Disease Image Classification by Using Evolutionary Algorithm-based NAS  


In the "model" folder:  
ESES.py is the main function of GA  
Init_dld.py is data preprocessing  
utils.py is training function  
We can run demo_model.ipynb or wholemodel.py to implement training and pruning  

In visualization/gradcam_vis we can run vis_gradcam to implement gradcam and dff  

In visualization/mad_vis we can run feature_extraction.py to extract and save feature, then we can run demoMDA.py to implement mda
